# Customers Reviews SQL Project

This project aims to understand feedback from customers that stores use to improve.

1. From Write Table to ElephantSQL file
   - There are 3 tables -> customers tables, products tables and reviews tables
   - The process involves creating a database on ElephantSQL and then connecting to the server from Posit Cloud to write those tables to the server
  
2. From Execute Code file
   - To gain insights, I connect to Posit Cloud, which allows me to query ElephantSQL using SQL.
